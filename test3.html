<h2>About Steph Curry</h2>
        <p>
    <strong> Stephen Curry</strong> is my all time favourite basketball player. </p>
				<p>Stephen Curry is considered one of the most exciting and influential players in basketball history because of his unmatched shooting ability, creativity, and flair. His deep three-pointers, often taken from far beyond the arc, have completely changed how the game is played — encouraging teams to embrace faster, more perimeter-oriented offenses.</p> <p> What makes Curry special isn't just his shooting accuracy, but also his quick release, incredible ball-handling, and off-the-ball movement, which constantly keeps defenders guessing. Fans love watching him because he plays with joy, confidence, and a sense of fearlessness, often turning games into highlight reels.</p> <p> His relatively smaller size (by NBA standards) also makes him more relatable and inspiring — showing that skill, work ethic, and determination can outshine pure physical dominance.<p></p>
